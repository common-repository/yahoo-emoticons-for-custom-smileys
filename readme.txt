I use Custom Smilies 2.3 plugin. However, I prefer Yahoo! emoticons. This is a tweak to allow use of those emoticons with Custom Smilies 2.3.

== Description ==

Works with Custom Smilies 2.3!

I use Custom Smilies 2.3 plugin. However, I prefer the Yahoo! Messenger emoticons. So, I did some digging, found them all, then tweaked my plugin to use those emoticons. Yahoo! Emoticons for Custom Smilies 2.3 is a tweak for the plugin Custom Smilies 2.3 found at http://goto8848.net/ . This updates files within that plugin so that you can use Yahoo! Emoticons with your Wordpress installation. To save some time for anyone else who wants to do this, I've made this tweak available for everyone.

Important: If something breaks, please keep in mind that I've only added smilies to an existing plugin. If you have problems, I recommend uninstalling this plugin and downloading the original plugin to see if it works first: http://goto8848.net/projects/custom-smilies/

== Installation ==

1. Download and extract yahoo-emoticons-for-custom-Smilies.zip.
2. Upload the new 'smilies' folder to your '/wp-includes/images' directory.
3. Activate the plugin in your Plugins admin panel.
4. To customize this plugin further, see the Smilies pane under Settings.
5. For more advanced use, see http://goto8848.net/projects/custom-smiles
